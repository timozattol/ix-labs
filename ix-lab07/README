What movies do you get back when you use this description as a
query string? Can you explain why “Babe (1981)” has such a high ranking?
=> The only common word is "modeling", this is strange <==============================

3.1
We already coded this for you, simply run TermDocumentMatrix
on the cluster. How many rows and columns does the matrix have?
=>

Run the Concepts command on the cluster to get a feel of the concepts behind the first
few dimensions uncovered by the transformation. The first dimension is particularly striking.
How can you explain what you see?

craft a review that will be classified as truthful?
