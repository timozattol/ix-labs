* Look at the graph depicted in Figure 1. Intuitively, can you order the 5 nodes by decreasing
PageRank score? Imagine that you follow a random walk in the graph and count the proportion
of times you land on each node

1 = 2 = 3 > 0 > 4


* Consider the two graphs components.graph and absorbing.graph. As explained before,
you can use scripts/draw.py to draw these graphs. Can you identify any problems if we
want to run our naive random surfer implementation on them?

Yes, absorbing.graph has a node whose outdegree is zero, thus the program will fail. 
Also, components.graph has two disconnected components so the outcome depends on the 
starting node.

* Run your implementation of NaiveRandomSurfer on these two graphs. What happens?

First one fails (random.nextInt(0) can't work), second one gives zero probabilities
for one of the component at random (depending on where it starts).
