1.2
Run k-means on the synthetic dataset with k = 2 clusters. How does the distortion (fit of
data to the clusters) measure evolve? Analyze the clusters and assignments found.

=> The distortion converges to about 5000 after about 6 iterations.

Keeping the same number of clusters k, run your code on the dataset of tweets location.
Analyze the results you obtain by plotting the evolution of different clusters and their centers.
After convergence of k-means, how is the geographical distribution of the clusters? What
does the clustering obtained capture?
