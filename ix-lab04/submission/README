1. How many faces are there in the dataset, and how many measurements are provided for each
face? That is, what are the values of N and M? In Faces.java, complete the top of the
function main(). Hint: although we provide the images behind the first 1000 faces only,
there are many more in the dataset.

2. What is the variance3 of the data along each dimension? Complete the function variance(),
run Faces and enter variance when prompted for an action. Take advantage of the unit
tests in FacesTest to check your implementation.
