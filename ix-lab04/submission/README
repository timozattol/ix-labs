1. How many faces are there in the dataset, and how many measurements are provided for each
face? That is, what are the values of N and M? In Faces.java, complete the top of the
function main(). Hint: although we provide the images behind the first 1000 faces only,
there are many more in the dataset.


- 5000 faces and 50 measurement 


2. What is the variance3 of the data along each dimension? Complete the function variance(),
run Faces and enter variance when prompted for an action. Take advantage of the unit
tests in FacesTest to check your implementation.

- Check the plot


3. Simply by looking at the images, can you identify the different sources of variability between
the faces? Phrased differently: how many numbers would you need to precisely describe the
variable part of a face?

- 7 sources: face, hair, eyes and hat color; eyes, hair size; mouth shape.


4. How does this compare to the dimension of the measurement vector outputted by FaceAnalyzr
for each face?

- 50 is a lot more than 7, a lot of values are probably irrelevant.


5. By looking at the images and their corresponding row in the dataset (e.g. face0000.png
corresponds to the 1st line in data/faces.txt), are you able to identify any correlation
between facial features and vector values?

- We really tried, but no... It's too difficult to do it "by hand"

7. Run Face with the action pca, and look at the plot of the variances. How many components
stand out? How does this relate to your intuition about the variability of the faces?

- 6 components stand out, which is one less than what we found. We can suppose two things: 
either the FaceAnalyzer algorithm does not detect one of the 7 variables, or there is an
underlying correlation between empirically observed variables, and there actually are only
6 degrees of freedom.


9. Using the action extremes you can see which of the 1000 first faces have extremal values
along any dimension4
in the new space. By visually comparing faces with low values to faces
with high values for the first few dimensions, map each principal component to a variable
facial feature.

- 1: mouth shape (smallest = smile, largest = sad)
- 2: eye size (smallest = big eyes, largest = small eyes)
- 3: eye color (smallest = dark eyes, largest = turquoise eyes)
- 4: hair size (smallest = short, largest = long)
- 5: hair color (smallest = blond, largest = brown)
- 6: face color (smallest = dark, largest = light)

- 7: as expected, no visible correlation

10. There is no image attached to the item at row 3797 of the dataset. Can you give a description
of the main facial features? You should be able to do it with the machinery implemented so
far.

- We computed the 6 first dimensions for row 3797:

Dimension 1: -80.07
Dimension 2: -18.02
Dimension 3: 9.86
Dimension 4: -4.71
Dimension 5: -3.91
Dimension 6: -0.86

The face probably has a smiling face, big turquoise eyes, short blond hair and relatively dark face color
